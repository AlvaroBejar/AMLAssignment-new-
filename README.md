Required libraries: Keras, OpenCV, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Joblib, Face_recognition

The folder **models** contains the saved models for each task

The folder **test_results** contains the results on the independent test dataset released

Outlier detection in Task A is in task_A.py

Each classification attempt in Task C has its own file which contains the training and saving of each model:

- age_identification.py
- emotion_recognition.py
- glasses_detection.py
- human_detection.py
- hair_color_recognition.py

The testing of all models on the independent dataset is contained in **model_testing.py**

The file **Features.py** contains a class that was used to extract the relevant features used for each classification task
